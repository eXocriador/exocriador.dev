  description: [
    "I'm a passionate frontend developer who believes that great software is built at the intersection of technical excellence and human-centered design. Every line of code I write is driven by a simple philosophy: technology should serve people, not the other way around.",
    "My journey in web development began with curiosity and has evolved into a deep appreciation for the craft. I'm fascinated by how small details—a subtle animation, a perfectly timed transition, or an intuitive interaction—can transform a functional application into an experience that users love to use.",
    "When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new design trends, experimenting with emerging technologies, or contributing to open-source projects. I believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge with the developer community."
